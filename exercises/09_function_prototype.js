// -> Define a 'Robot' function constructor
// -> Create two instances of Robot: 'robby' and 'cranky'
// -> Both robby and cranky should respond to 'parts' and 'capabilities', these
//    should be empty arrays at first

__;

// -> What is the result of robby.parts?
// -> What is result of cranky.parts?
// -> What is result of robby.capabilities?
// -> What is result of cranky.capabilities?

// -> Add 'core' to robby.parts, cranky.parts should still be empty
// -> Add 'fly' to robby.capabilities, after doing that cranky.capabilities must
//    also have 'fly' without adding to it directly, so this property has to be
//    shared
